</div>
<p class="drop-capi-t">The story of the last great act in the drama of American
independence has been told many times, but never
more vividly than in the words of the actors themselves.
This book is an attempt to portray the crowning campaign
of the American Revolution in the language of participants.
Cornwallis, commander of the British forces, and Tarleton, his dashing
cavalry leader, have been called upon to describe scenes and
events inside Yorktown, during the campaign which culminated in
the surrender of Cornwallis’s army and was followed by the
abandonment of British efforts to reduce the revolting American
colonies to their old allegiance. Washington, “Mad” Anthony
Wayne, Surgeon Thacher of the Continental Line, the young and
chivalrous Count William de Deux-Ponts, and others recount for
us American and French operations around Yorktown, for the
most part in words penned while the events themselves were transpiring.
Lafayette writes exultantly, on the heels of the surrender,
that “the play is over,” and Washington congratulates the army
on its success. Here is the story of the siege of Yorktown recorded
by those who were a part of it.</p>

<p>Here also are estimates of the significance of the surrender by a
contemporary American statesman who was in position to view
its immediate effects on the watching European world, by an
American President who saw Yorktown against the background of
a century’s independent national development, and by the commission
which prepared the sesquicentennial celebration of the
event in 1931. There has been added only sufficient new narrative
to fill the obvious gaps in the accounts of contemporaries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_1">1. <span class="smcap">Cornwallis Goes to Yorktown</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the spring of 1781, the seventh year of the struggle for American
independence, Lord Cornwallis, commanding a British Army,
marched from North Carolina into Virginia, in an attempt to conquer
the State and restore it to allegiance to Great Britain. The
Marquis de Lafayette, sent to Virginia with a small American force,
was unable to meet him in open battle but did his best to hamper
the movements of the British. In midsummer Cornwallis received
orders from Sir Henry Clinton, his superior in New York, to fortify
a base in the lower Chesapeake for the use of the British fleet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir, I was honoured with your letter of the 12th of July, by the Solebay, in which
you mention a desire of having a harbour secured in the Chesapeak for line of battle
ships. I immediately ordered the engineers to examine Old Point Comfort, and
went thither myself with the captains of the navy on this station. You will
receive a copy of the engineer’s report, with a sketch of the peninsula, and the
opinion of the officers of the navy relative to the occupying and fortifying of that
post.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief having signified to me in his letter of the 11th instant,
that he thought a secure harbour for line of battle ships of so much importance
in the Chesapeak, that he wished me to possess one, even if it should occupy
all the force at present in Virginia; and, as it is our unanimous opinion, that Point
Comfort will not answer the purpose, I shall immediately sieze and fortify the
posts of York and Gloucester, and shall be happy at all times to concur in any
measures which may promote the convenience and advantage of his Majesty’s
navy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_2">2. <span class="smcap">The French Fleet Blockades The Chesapeake</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cornwallis moved his whole army to Yorktown, on the York
River, in August and began leisurely fortifying that position and
Gloucester Point opposite. Meanwhile the French West Indies
fleet, under Comte de Grasse, evaded its British opponent and
moved north to cooperate with the French and American land forces
under Washington and Rochambeau. De Grasse sailed for the
mouth of Chesapeake Bay to blockade Cornwallis by sea, while the<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
allied armies prepared to leave the Hudson River, where they had
been threatening Clinton, and close in by land. Lt. Col. Banastre
Tarleton, Cornwallis’s cavalry leader, watched the gathering of
hostile forces.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Near the end of August, the Guadaloupe of twenty-eight guns, left York town,
to proceed to New York with dispatches from Earl Cornwallis, and from Captain
Symonds of the Charon, who commanded his Majesty’s ships in the Chesapeak.
At this period, the sea officers imagined that the British fleet from the West
Indies would be discovered off the capes by the frigate, and the land officers
expected that a considerable body of troops would soon arrive from New York to
strengthen the King’s forces for solid operations in Virginia, and likewise to
garrison the works which were constructing for the advantage and protection of
both army and navy. These suppositions, which were well grounded, diffused
among the royalists general satisfaction: but their prospects of glory were suddenly
obscured. On the 30th, the French fleet, of twenty-eight sail of the line,
from the West Indies, under orders of the Count de Grasse, entered the Chesapeak.
The advanced guard of his squadron, consisting of the Glorieux, a coppered
seventy-four, and the Diligente and Aigrette frigates, met the Guadaloupe
near the capes, who, not understanding their signals, kept aloof, and afterwards
by swiftness, made good her retreat to York town; whilst the Loyalist, a bad
twenty-gun ship, who was stationed in the bay, after a gallant struggle in the
mouth of the channel, fell into the possession of the French.</p>

<p>The Count de Grasse, without loss of time, blocked up York river with three
large ships and some frigates, and moored the principal part of the fleet in Lynhaven
bay. Upon his arrival within the capes, he dispatched information of that
event to General Washington in the Jerseys, and to the Marquis de la Fayette,
who was encamped near the Chickahomany. The disembarkation of the troops
brought in the line-of-battle ships from the West Indies immediately took place,
and the continental army in Virginia advanced to the Green springs on the 3d
of September, to form a junction with the Count de St. Simon. The Marquis de
la Fayette soon after moved the French and Americans to Williamsburgh.</p>

<p>In the mean time Earl Cornwallis practised various means to send intelligence
to New York of the situation and force of the French fleet. Patroles of the
legion cavalry were continually detached to the shores of James and York rivers,
and daily reported to his lordship every occurrence worthy of attention: They
informed him of the movement of the boats with troops towards the Chickahomany,
and of the different manoeuvres of the Count de Grasse. On the 5th, the
French ships were observed to make repeated signals, and it was soon discovered
that an English squadron was approaching. Notwithstanding the absence of a
number of officers and seamen employed in the disembarkation of St. Simon’s
brigade, and of another detachment engaged in procuring water, the French fleet

<p>This state of hope was interrupted by the arrival of Count de Barras’s division
in the Chesapeak from Rhode Island. Intelligence soon after reached York town,
that Count de Grasse had repulsed the British fleet, and was returning to the bay.
Before this period accounts were brought to Earl Cornwallis that General Washington,
with a large body of continentals, and Count Rochambeau, with the
French army, were preparing to form a junction with LaFayette, by descending
in transports from the head of Elk river in Maryland, under the convoy of the
French ships. In this situation, blocked up by sea, and exposed to a powerful
combination on shore, Earl Cornwallis turned his attention towards the corps
already arrived at Williamsburgh.</p>

<p>Williamsburg, at the heart of the Virginia Peninsula, commanded
the landward approach to Yorktown. Here, during September,
the allied armies gathered, Washington and Rochambeau hastening
down from the north to join the troops of Lafayette and St. Simon.
Richard Butler, then a colonel of the Pennsylvania Line, serving
with Lafayette, kept daily record of the scene.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Sept. 8th.</em>&mdash;Received orders to march for Williamsburgh to join the allied army;
arrived at our ground at 11 o’clock, had some difficulty in getting our baggage as
we had to let the allied army have our wagons to bring on their whole train and
camp, therefore had to lay in bough huts, on very dusty ground, for this day and
night; the French army, the Pennsylvania and light-troops made a very elegant
appearance in passing through the city.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 9th.</em>&mdash;Obtained our baggage, pitched our camp. Lay by without any
accounts of the enemy stirring on the eighth, the British fleet passed Cape Henry
and came into the bay, and were gallantly engaged by the French, who drove
them to sea, and pursued them, but leaving six ships of the line for the security
of the bay. The Baron de Steuben arrived in camp with his suite.</p>

<p><em>Aug.</em> [<em>sic.</em>] <em>11th.</em>&mdash;Accounts by a Frigate that the French were left in full pursuit
of the British, who were flying before them, and that in about six hours sailing
they must come up with eighteen sail of victuallers which the British intend for
Lord Cornwallis’ relief and support, which they had abandoned in their flight.
Still no flour or meal, and the beef supplied is very bad, in short there is yet no
exertions made to supply the troops who have been supplied with only three
days’ bread out of seven, and not the least likelihood of being better supplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p><em>Sept. 12th.</em>&mdash;Several cannon heard down the river; no account from the fleet.
This day Governor Nelson sent Mr. Nichols to give me an order to retain a mill,
and to impress corn carriages, boats, or any thing to facilitate the collecting of
provisions; sent off Lieutenant Collier with a party for this purpose.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 13th.</em>&mdash;An account of the Commander-in-Chief having arrived at his own
seat at last. He has not been within his own door for seven years, indeed not
since he was first a member of Congress in the year 1775, all which time he has
been a most faithful patriot and servant of his country, from the citizen he was a
councellor, then a General, and in reality the Father of the people, he has nobly
shared in all their misfortunes, shewing the utmost fortitude and regularity of
conduct; indeed the able statesman has appeared in all his actions. Some malign
shafts have been shot at him by a small insignificant tribe whose falsely and ill
directed arrows always reverted to their own bow and wounded themselves.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 14th.</em>&mdash;The Marquis Lafayette still continues ill of the ague. Yesterday
the Marquis de St. Simon, and a number of his officers, paid a visit to our line, and
the Baron Steuben and our good friend Gen. Wayne, whose wound and gout still
continue ill. About 3 o’clock an express arrived, announcing the approach of our
great and good Commander-in-Chief, Gen. Washington, and the Count de
Rochambeau, the commander of the allied armies of France, now joining. At
4, P. M., the guns fired a royal salute as the General approached the camp, on
which the two armies turned out on their battalion parades;&mdash;his Excellency and
the Count De Rochambeau, with their suites, attended by the Marquis de
Lafayette, Maj. Gen. and commander of the American, and Maj. Gen. Marquis
de St. Simon, commander of the allied army (lately arrived), and all their suites,
visited the allied army first, and then the American army, and were saluted
according to custom; these ceremonies finished, the whole of the officers of the
French army attended at the Marquis de St. Simon’s quarters and were introduced
to the <em>Illustrious Hero</em>. The field officers of the American army all attended to
bid him and the other Generals welcome. These ceremonies over, an elegant
supper was served up.... To add to the happiness of the event and evening,
an elegant band of music played an introductive part of a French Opera, signifying
the happiness of the family when blessed with the presence of their father, and
their great dependance upon him. About 10 o’clock the company rose up, and
after mutual congratulations and the greatest expression of joy, they separated.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 15th.</em>&mdash;An officer arrived from Count de Grasse’s fleet, with certain account
of the arrival of his and Count de Barras’ fleet, from Rhode Island, with the
French troops on board, and heavy artillery and large mortars, also of the capture
of the <em>famous</em> Iris frigate, and the Richmond frigate, which with the Romulus
of 44 guns, are sent to Baltimore, and head of Elk, to bring down all our troops
and apparatus for a siege; the storm seems to thicken fast about Lord Cornwallis,
whose people desert fast, which is a certain symptom of despondency in all armies.
This day, his Excellency, the Commander-in-Chief, dined with the Marquis de<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
Lafayette, also Marquis de St. Simon, Baron de Steuben, Count de Rochambeau,
Dumas, and Desandroins, a number of American and French officers of distinction,

Chastelleux, and a great number of Generals and other officers dined with Baron
de Steuben; we spent the afternoon in great harmony and retired.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 17 to 27.</em>&mdash;Has been spent in debarking the troops and trains from the
shipping the whole being arrived, the troops having taken their proper stations
and every thing arranged, and the Commander-in-Chief and principal officers
returned from on board the Ville de Paris where the Generals have been fixing a
plan of cooperation with the Admiral, orders were issued for the whole army to
move at 5 o’clock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cornwallis had not been idle. The unexpected
appearance of the French fleet in the bay, its repulse of the British
fleet, and the gathering of his enemies at Williamsburg had spurred
him to renewed exertions in preparing the defenses of Yorktown.
His outer line was extensive but well chosen. His inner line, close
about the town, was less advantageous.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At this period, the labour which had been bestowed on the outward position
at York town, had improved its natural advantages, and rendered it in every
respect convenient for the King’s troops. The right rested on a swamp which
cover the right of the town: A large redoubt was constructed beyond it, close to
the river road from Williamsburgh, and completed with fraizing and abbatis.
The Charon, Guadaloupe, and other armed vessels, were moored opposite to the
swamp; and the town batteries commanded at the roads and causeways which
approached it. On the right, at the head of the morass, two redoubts were placed,
one on each side, of the main Williamsburgh road. The center was protected by
a thin wood, whose front was cut down, with the branches facing outwards. A
field work, mounted with cannon, was erected on the left of the center, to command
the Hampton road. A deep ravine, and a creek, which increased till it reached
York river, covered the left. Trees were felled, fleches were thrown up, and batteries
were constructed, at the points which were deemed most vulnerable. The
distance between the heads of the swamp and creek, which embraced the flanks
of the town, did not exceed half a mile. The face of the country, in front of this
line, was cut near the center by a morass, and, excepting this break, the ground
was plain and open for near two thousand yards. An excellent field artillery was
placed to the greatest advantage by Captain Rochefort, who commanded in that
department....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>The works erected for the protection of York town, consisted, on the right, of
redoubts and batteries, with a line of stockade in the rear, which supported a high
parapet of earth. The redoubts were furnished with fraizing and abbatis. A
marshy ravine lay in front of the right, over which was placed a large redoubt,
with a good ditch, fraizing, and abbatis: The morass extended along the center,
which was defended by a line of stockade, and by batteries that looked upon all
the avenues to the swamp: On the left of the center, was a horn work, with a
ditch, a row of fraize, and an abbatis: Some embrazures for cannon were at present
open in this work. The left was fortified by redoubts, communications of earth,
and batteries, which were all furnished with fraizing, but without stockade or
abbatis. Two redoubts were advanced before the left, which were small, and
not so well finished as that in front of the right. The ground in front of the left
was in some parts on a level with the works, in others cut by ravines, and altogether
very convenient for the besiegers. The space within the works was exceedingly
narrow, not large enough for retrenchments, and, except under the
cliff, exposed to enfilade.</p>

<p>French and American troops having assembled in overwhelming
force, from points as far distant as Rhode Island and the West
Indies, Washington assumed command of the whole and moved
on Yorktown.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have not leisure to give a particular account of our proceedings, it must
suffice only to inform you, that, after assembling all the Troops at <em>Williamsburg</em>,
and making the necessary Arrangements, the Allied Army moved on the Morning
of the 28th Sept. and took post in the neighbourhood of York that night. The
Enemy gave us no annoyance on the March; a body of Horse that was paraded in
front of their Works retired upon our firing a few shot among them. The 29th.
was spent in reconnoitring, and taking a position as near the advanced Works as
could be done without placing the Encampments directly in the range of the
Enemy’s shot; some skirmishing happened between our Riffle men and the Yagers,
in which the former had the advantage. At night, the Enemy abandoned all
their Out Posts (some of which were very advantageous) and retired to the Town.
Yesterday Morning we occupied the same ground and last night made some
lodgments at a short distance from the Lines. The Horses and Teams are beginning
to arrive from the Northward, the heavy Artillery will be brought up as soon
as possible and the Seige pushed with vigor; as I have no Idea that Lord Cornwallis
will surrender so respectable a force, as he has under his command, unless he is
compelled by dire necessity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_6">6. <span class="smcap">The First Parallel</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The siege operations of the eighteenth century were conducted
according to a set pattern. When the most advantageous ground
had been chosen and marked, the besiegers began digging a line
of entrenchments facing the besieged position at a distance of from
800 to 1,000 yards, convenient range for the artillery of that day.
This line of entrenchments, in which batteries were erected, was
known as the “first parallel.” In planning the siege of Yorktown,
the allied engineers chose for the first parallel a line from the head
of a deep ravine, which half encircled the town on the left, to the
York River on the right. Its opening was delayed for several days
pending the arrival of heavy artillery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reconnoissance completed, the artillery disembarked, and the necessary
supplies arranged, the establishment of the first parallel was begun.</p>

<p>The strength and reputation of the Garrison were the reason for the decision
to establish it at the usual distance, and to fortify it by redoubts against sorties.
The advanced works on the enemy’s left made it necessary even to increase the
distance of the right of the attacks from the body of the place. The lay of the
ground determined its outline; the right resting on the steep bank of the river, on
the left of the great ravine.</p>

<p>In the night of the 6th to 7th, the first parallel was opened, and the construction
of the redoubts necessary for safety began. This work was only interrupted by
the batteries, the fire of which was turned upon the new redoubts from the beginning
of their construction.</p>

<p>The same night an end of a parallel with a flying sap was opened to support a
battery which served the double purpose of disturbing the advanced redoubt on
the right of the besieged and of driving off the ships of war which might have
taken the left of the great attack in reverse.</p>

<p>This work, information of which was given by a deserter, was greatly troubled
by the batteries of the besieged, and the attention which they paid to it diverted
their attention from the opening of the great attack.</p>

<p><em>October 7th.</em>&mdash;At daybreak the guard batteries entered the parallel. From the
7th to 8th the perfectionment of the first parallel and the redoubts was continued,
and the construction of the batteries begun. The nature of the ground on the
left decided their establishment behind the parallel, and one was placed on its
left flank beyond the ravine.</p>

<p><em>October 8th.</em>&mdash;At noon the parallel and the battery at the left attack were
completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>From the 8th to the 9th the perfectionment of the parallel, and of the redoubts
and batteries was continued, and communications opened in their rear.</p>

<p><em>October 9th.</em>&mdash;The construction of a battery of mortars was begun in part of the
parallel.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the batteries began their fire, and subdued that of the enemy.</p>

<p>The fire of that on the left compelled the frigate and the other vessels of war to
withdraw.</p>

<p>From the 9th to the 10th the perfecting of the works was continued, and palisades
were set in the ditches of the redoubts.</p>

<p>On the left attempts were made to set fire to the abattis of the redoubt.</p>

</div>


<p>Some of the allied batteries were ready to fire by the afternoon
of October 9. All movements and activities up to this time had
been merely preliminary. The siege of Yorktown now settled into
deadly earnest, with a heavy and continuous bombardment of the
British position. Additional batteries took up the chorus on the
following morning. Surgeon Thacher, of the American Army, in
the intervals of caring for the wounded, watched the terrible
spectacle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the 10th to the 15th, a tremendous and incessant firing from the American
and French batteries is kept up, and the enemy return the fire, but with little
effect. A red hot shell from the French battery set fire to the Charon, a British
44 gun ship, and two or three smaller vessels at anchor in the river, which were
consumed in the night. From the bank of the river, I had a fine view of this
splendid conflagration. The ships were enwrapped in a torrent of fire, which
spreading with vivid brightness among the combustible rigging, and running with
amazing rapidity to the tops of the several masts, while all around was thunder
and lightning from our numerous cannon and mortars, and in the darkness of
night, presented one of the most sublime and magnificent spectacles which can be
imagined. Some of our shells, overreaching the town, are seen to fall into the
river, and bursting, throw up columns of water like the spouting of the monsters
of the deep. We have now made further approaches to the town, by throwing
up a second parallel line, and batteries within about three hundred yards; this
was effected in the night, and at daylight the enemy were roused to the greatest
exertions, the engines of war have raged with redoubled fury and destruction on
both sides, no cessation day or night. The French had two officers wounded,
and fifteen men killed or wounded, and among the Americans, two or three were
wounded. I assisted in amputating a man’s thigh. The siege is daily becoming<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
more and more formidable and alarming, and his Lordship must view his situation
as extremely critical, if not desperate.</p>

<p>Being in the trenches every other night and day, I have a fine opportunity of
witnessing the sublime and stupendous scene which is continually exhibiting.
The bomb shells from the besiegers and the besieged are incessantly crossing each
others’ path in the air. They are clearly visible in the form of a black ball in the
day, but in the night, they appear like fiery meteors with blazing tails, most
beautifully brilliant, ascending majestically from the mortar to a certain altitude,
and gradually descending to the spot where they are destined to execute their
work of destruction. It is astonishing with what accuracy an experienced gunner
will make his calculations, that a shell shall fall within a few feet of a given point,
and burst at the precise time, though at a great distance. When a shell falls, it
whirls round, burrows, and excavates the earth to a considerable extent, and
bursting, makes dreadful havoc around. I have more than once witnessed
fragments of the mangled bodies and limbs of the British soldiers thrown into
the air by the bursting of our shells, and by one from the enemy, Captain White,
of the seventh Massachusetts regiment, and one soldier were killed, and another
wounded near where I was standing. About twelve or fourteen men have been
killed or wounded within twenty-four hours; I attended at the hospital, amputated
a man’s arm, and assisted in dressing a number of wounds.</p>

<p>Under cover of the fire of their heavy guns, the allies moved
forward on the night of October 11 to a second parallel, halfway
to the main British line. At the right, nearest the river, the
completion of this entrenchment was delayed by the fire of two
advanced redoubts held by the British. It was determined to
storm them. Early on the evening of October 14 French troops
prepared to attack one of the redoubts, while picked American
units from Lafayette’s Light Infantry assaulted the other. Count
William de Deux-Ponts led the French attack, while Lt. Col.
Alexander Hamilton was at the head of the American column.</p>

<h3>THE FRENCH ATTACK</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The six shells were fired at last; and I advanced in the greatest silence; at a
hundred and twenty or thirty paces, we were discovered; and the Hessian soldier
who was stationed as a sentinel on the parapet, cried out “Werda?” (Who comes
there?) to which we did not reply, but hastened our steps. The enemy opened
fire the instant after the “Werda.” We lost not a moment in reaching the abatis,
which being strong and well preserved, at about twenty-five paces from the redoubt,
cost us many men, and stopped us for some minutes, but was cleared away
with brave determination; we threw ourselves into the ditch at once, and each
one sought to break through the fraises, and to mount the parapet.</p>

<p>We reached there at first in small numbers, and I gave the order to fire; the
enemy kept up a sharp fire, and charged us at the point of the bayonet; but no
one was driven back. The carpenters, who had worked hard on their part, had
made some breaches in the palisades, which helped the main body of the troops in
mounting. The parapet was becoming manned visibly. Our fire was increasing,
and making terrible havoc among the enemy, who had placed themselves behind
a kind of intrenchment of barrels, where they were well massed, and where all
our shots told. We succeeded at the moment when I wished to give the order to
leap into the redoubt and charge upon the enemy with the bayonet; then they laid
down their arms, and we leaped in with more tranquillity and less risk. I shouted
immediately the cry of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Roi</i>, which was repeated by all the grenadiers and
chasseurs who were in good condition, by all the troops in the trenches, and to
which the enemy replied by a general discharge of artillery and musketry. I
never saw a sight more beautiful or more majestic. I did not stop to look at it:
I had to give attention to the wounded, and directions to be observed towards
the prisoners.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Baron de Viomesnil came to give me orders to be prepared
for a vigorous defence, as it would be important for the enemy to attempt to retake
this work. An active enemy would not have failed, and the Baron de Viomesnil
judged the English general by himself. I made my dispositions to the best of my
ability; the enemy showered bullets upon us. I did not doubt that the idea of the
Baron de Viomesnil would be fulfilled. Finally, when all was over, a sentinel
charged with observing the movements without, called me, and said that some of
the enemy were appearing. I raised my head above the parapet, and at the same
time a ball, which ricochetted in the parapet, and passed very near my head,
covered my face with sand and gravel. I suffered much, and was obliged to leave
the place, and to be conducted to the ambulance.</p>

<h3>THE AMERICAN ATTACK</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to render you an account of the corps under my command,
in your attack of last night upon the redoubt of the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p>Agreeable to your orders, we advanced in two columns with unloaded arms,
the right composed of Lieutenant-colonel Gimat’s battalion and my own, commanded
by Major Fish. The left of a detachment commanded by Lieutenant-colonel
Laurens, destined to take the enemy of reverse, and intercept their retreat.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
The column on the right hand was preceded by a van guard of twenty men, led
by Lieutenant Mansfield; and a detachment of sappers and miners, commanded
by Captain Gilliland, for the purpose of removing obstructions.</p>

<p>The redoubt was commanded by Major Campbell, with a detachment of British
and German troops, and was completely in a state of defence.</p>

<p>The rapidity and immediate success of the assault, are the best comment on the
behaviour of the troops. Lieutenant-colonel Laurens distinguished himself by an
exact and vigourous execution of his part of the plan, by entering the enemy’s
work with his corps among the foremost, and making prisoner of the commanding
officer of the redoubt. Lieutenant-colonel Gimat’s battalion, which formed the
van of the right attack, and which fell under my immediate observation, encouraged
by the decisive and animated example of their leader, advanced with an
order and resolution superior to every obstacle. They were well seconded by
Major Fish, with the battalion under his command, who, when the front of the
column reached the abbatis, unlocking his corps to the left, as he had been directed,
advanced with such celerity, as to arrive in time to participate in the assault.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mansfield deserves particular commendation, for the coolness,
firmness, and punctuality, with which he conducted the van guard, Captain Olney
who commanded the first platoon of Gimat’s battalion, is entitled to peculiar
applause. He led his platoon into the work with exemplary intrepidity, and received
two bayonet wounds. Captain Gilliland, with the detachment of sappers
and miners, acquitted themselves in a manner that did them great honour.</p>

<p>I do but justice to the several corps when I have the pleasure to assure you,
there was not an officer nor soldier whose behaviour if it could be particularized,
would not have a claim to the warmest approbation. As it would have been attended
with delay and loss to wait for the removal of the abbatis and pallisades,
the ardour of the troops was indulged in passing over them.</p>

<p>There was a happy coincidence of movements. The redoubt was in the same
moment inveloped and carried on every part. The enemy are entitled to the
acknowledgment of an honourable defence.</p>

the British, with a party of the Light Infantry and Guards, made a sally, and
passing between two small redoubts that were unfinished, and where (by the parties
being moved in another post to work,) the line was weak, got possession of the
trench; thence they pushed rapidly to a French battery, and spiked the guns and
drove out the people, having killed four or five: Thence to the covert way or communication
leading from the first to the second parallel, where they halted. They
then discovered a battery commanded by Capt. Savage, of the Americans and
challenged, What troops? The answer was French&mdash;on which the order of the
British Commandant was “Push on, my brave boys, and skin the b&mdash;&mdash;rs.” This
was heard by Count de Noailles, who had the command of a covering party,
which he ordered to advance, and was guided by the Huzza of the British. He
ordered grenadiers to “charge bayonet and rush on,” which they did with great
spirit crying “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Le Roy</i>”, and to use the British phrase skivered eight of the
Guards and Infantry, and took twelve prisoners, and drove them quite off.
The British spiked Savage’s three guns with the points of bayonets, but our
smiths and artillery men soon cleared all the guns, and in six hours chastised the
enemy for their temerity with the same pieces. Our loss was very trifling, though
the British really executed the sortie with secrecy and spirit.</p>

<p>Finding his enemies closing in for the kill, Cornwallis determined
on a desperate measure. This was to transport his army across the
river to Gloucester, break through the allied troops guarding that
point, and march overland to New York.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A few hours cannonade from the new batteries upon York town, where the
fraizings were already destroyed, the guns dismounted, many breaches effected,
and the shells nearly expended, would be productive either of a capitulation, or an
assault. A retreat by Gloucester was the only expedient that now presented itself
to avert the mortification of a surrender, or the destruction of a storm. Though
this plan appeared less practicable than when first proposed, and was adopted
at this crisis, as the last resource, it yet afforded some hopes of success. In the
evening, Earl Cornwallis sent Lord Chewton to Gloucester, with explicit directions
for Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton to prepare some artillery and other requisites
from his garrison to accompany the British troops with which his lordship designed
to attack Brigadier de Choisy before daybreak, and afterwards retreat through
the country. The guards of cavalry and infantry at Tarleton’s post were immediately
augmented, and many officers were advanced as sentries, to prevent
any intelligence being conveyed to the enemy. All the commanding officers of
regiments were afterwards acquainted with the intended project, that their corps
might be completely assembled and equipped. The spare horses of the garrison
were ordered to parade for the benefit of the infantry, and the necessary artillery
and waggons were prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>A number of sailors and soldiers were dispatched with boats from Gloucester,
to assist the troops in passing the river. Earl Cornwallis sent off the first embarkation
before eleven o’clock that night, consisting of the light infantry, great
part of the brigade of guards, and the 23d regiment, and purposed himself to pass
with the second, when he had finished a letter to General Washington, calculated
to excite the humanity of that officer towards the sick, the wounded, and the
detachment that would be left to capitulate. Much of the small craft had been
damaged during the siege; yet it was computed, that three trips would be sufficient
to convey over all the troops that were necessary for the expedition. The whole
of the first division arrived before midnight, and part of the second had embarked,
when a squall, attended with rain, scattered the boats, and impeded their return
to Gloucester. About two o’clock in the morning the weather began to moderate,
when orders were brought to the commanding officers of the corps that had passed,
to re-cross the water. As the boats were all on the York side the river, in order
to bring over the troops, it required some time to row them to Gloucester, to carry
back the infantry of the first embarkation; but soon after daybreak they returned
under the fire of the enemy’s batteries to Earl Cornwallis, at Yorktown. Thus
expired the last hope of the British army.</p>

<p>With the failure of the attempt to escape, and the opening of the
batteries in the advanced allied line, the position of the British
Army, as Cornwallis realized, became hopeless.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our works in the mean time were going to ruin, and not having been able to
strengthen them by abbatis, nor in any other manner but by a slight fraizing which
the enemy’s artillery were demolishing wherever they fired, my opinion entirely
coincided with that of the engineer and principal officers of the army, that they
were in many places assailable in the forenoon, and that by the continuance of the
same fire for a few hours longer, they would be in such a state as to render it
desperate with our numbers to attempt to maintain them. We at that time
could not fire a single gun, only one eight-inch and little more than an hundred
cohorn shells remained; a diversion by the French ships of war that lay at the
mouth of York-river, was to be expected. Our numbers had been diminished by
the enemy’s fire, but particularly by sickness, and the strength and spirits of those
in the works were much exhausted by the fatigue of constant watching and unremitting<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
duty. Under all these circumstances, I thought it would have been
wanton and inhuman to the last degree to sacrifice the lives of this small body of
gallant soldiers, who had ever behaved with so much fidelity and courage, by
exposing them to an assault, which from the numbers and precautions of the enemy
could not fail to succeed. I therefore proposed to capitulate....</p>

<p><em>17th.</em>&mdash;The enemy beat the chamade at 10 o’clock, A. M.</p>

<p>Cornwallis now “sent out a flag, proposing a cessation of hostilities for twenty-four
hours, ... and that commissioners might be appointed to meet at Mr.
Moore’s house, to settle the terms upon which the garrisons of York and Gloucester
should surrender. General Washington would only grant a cessation for <em>two
hours</em>; previously to the expiration of which, his lordship, by another flag, sent the
following terms, viz: The troops to be prisoners of war; the British to be sent to
Great Britain, and not to act against America, France, or their allies, until exchanged;
the Hessians to Germany, on the same conditions; and that all operations
cease until the commissioners should determine the details. To this his excellency
returned for answer: That hostilities should cease, and no alterations in the
works, or any new movement of the troops, take place, until he sent terms in writing;
which he did on the 18th, at nine o’clock, A. M., allowing the enemy two hours
to determine. They again requested more time; and the general granted them
until one o’clock, when they acceded to the heads of the imposed terms, and
nominated Colonel Dundas and Major Ross, on their part, to meet with Colonel
Laurens and Viscount de Noailles on ours, to reduce them to form, which was
completed by nine o’clock at night; and, on the 19th, at one o’clock, P. M., the
capitulation was ratified and signed by the commander of each army, when the
enemy received a guard of Pennsylvania and Maryland troops in one of their
principal works, and one of French troops in another.</p>

</div>


<p>The terms settled, the victorious allies prepared to receive the
surrender of the British Army, while Cornwallis’s men made ready
for the humiliating ordeal with which they were faced.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>19th.</em>&mdash;This is to us a most glorious day, but to the English, one of bitter chagrin
and disappointment. Preparations are now making to receive as captives, that<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
vindictive, haughty commander, and that victorious army, who by their robberies
and murders have so long been a scourge to our brethren of the southern
states. Being on horseback, I anticipate a full share of satisfaction in viewing
the various movements in the interesting scene.</p>

<p>The stipulated terms of capitulation are similar to those granted to General
Lincoln at Charleston the last year. The captive troops are to march out with
shouldered arms, colors cased, and drums beating a British or German march,
and to ground their arms at a place assigned for the purpose. The officers are
allowed their side arms and private property, and the generals and such officers
as desire it, are to go on parole to England or New York. The marines and seamen
of the king’s ships are prisoners of war to the navy of France, and the land
forces to the United States. All military and artillery stores to be delivered up
unimpaired. The royal prisoners to be sent into the interior of Virginia, Maryland
and Pennsylvania, in regiments, to have rations allowed them equal to the American
soldiers, and to have their officers near them. Lord Cornwallis to man and
despatch the Bonetta sloop of war with despatches to Sir Henry Clinton at New
York without being searched, the vessel to be returned and the hands accounted for.</p>

<p>At about twelve o’clock, the combined army was arranged and drawn up in
two lines extending more than a mile in length. The Americans were drawn up in
a line on the right side of the road, and the French occupied the left. At the head
of the former the great American commander, mounted on his noble courser, took
his station, attended by his aids. At the head of the latter was posted the
excellent Count Rochambeau and his suite. The French troops, in complete
uniform, displayed a martial and noble appearance, their band of music, of which
the timbrel formed a part, is a delightful novelty, and produced while marching
to the ground, a most enchanting effect. The Americans though not all in
uniform nor their dress so neat, yet exhibited an erect soldierly air, and every
countenance beamed with satisfaction and joy. The concourse of spectators
from the country was prodigious, in point of numbers probably equal to the military,
but universal silence and order prevailed.</p>

<p>It was about two o’clock when the captive army advanced through the line
formed for their reception. Every eye was prepared to gaze on Lord Cornwallis,
the object of peculiar interest and solicitude; but he disappointed our anxious
expectations; pretending indisposition, he made General O’Harra his substitute
as the leader of his army. This officer was followed by the conquered troops in a
slow and solemn step, with shouldered arms, colors cased and drums beating a
British march. Having arrived at the head of the line, General O’Harra, elegantly
mounted, advanced to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, taking off his hat,
and apologized for the non-appearance of Earl Cornwallis. With his usual
dignity and politeness his Excellency pointed to Major General Lincoln for
directions, by whom the British army was conducted into a spacious field, where
it was intended they should ground their arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>The royal troops, while marching through the line formed by the allied army,
exhibited a decent and neat appearance, as respects arms and clothing, for their
commander opened his store and directed every soldier to be furnished with a new
suit complete, prior to the capitulation. But in their line of march we remarked
a disorderly and unsoldierly conduct, their step was irregular, and their ranks
frequently broken. But it was in the field when they came to the last act of the
drama, that the spirit and pride of the British soldier was put to the severest test,
here their mortification could not be concealed. Some of the platoon officers
appeared to be exceedingly chagrined when giving the word “<em>ground arms</em>,” and
I am a witness that they performed this duty in a very unofficerlike manner, and
that many of the soldiers manifested a <em>sullen temper</em>, throwing their arms on the
pile with violence, as if determined to render them useless. This irregularity,
however, was checked by the authority of General Lincoln. After having grounded
their arms and divested themselves of their accoutrements, the captive troops
were conducted back to Yorktown and guarded by our troops till they could be
removed to the place of their destination. The British troops that were stationed
at Gloucester surrendered at the same time, and in the same manner to the
command of the French general de Choise.</p>

<p>The surrender of Cornwallis was immediately recognized as bringing
within sight the end of the Revolution and the independence of
the United States.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your predictions regarding the fate of Lord Cornwallis have, thank God, been

that stroke and other nations begin to doubt less of the continuance of our independence.
Further successes must prepare the way for peace, and I hope that
victory will stimulate instead of relaxing our exertions.</p>

<p class="ir1"><span class="smcap">John Jay to Elbridge Gerry, Madrid, January 9, 1782.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The news of Yorktown brought the defeat of Lord North’s war
ministry in England. Negotiations ending in a treaty of peace,
with recognition of the independence of the United States, soon
followed. The succeeding century brought out in stronger relief
the significance of this decisive victory in the struggle for American
self-government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon this soil one hundred years ago our forefathers brought to a successful
issue their heroic struggle for independence. Here and then was established, and
as we trust made secure upon this continent for ages yet to come, that principle of
government which is the very fiber of our system&mdash;the sovereignty of the people.</p>

<p class="ir1"><span class="smcap">President Chester A. Arthur, Yorktown, October 19, 1881.</span></p>
</div>

<p>With the approach of the 150th anniversary of the Yorktown
victory, there was renewed realization of the meaning of the event
and of the debt which the people of the United States owed to the
men who, by that victory, made the Declaration of Independence
a living thing. The National Government and local organizations<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
in 1931 cooperated in impressive commemorative services, and the
battlefield of Yorktown was dedicated as a national shrine to be
maintained for the people by the National Park Service.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While the events commemorated in other national parks are well worth the
expense to the Government in commemorating them, and they all recall to the
minds of the citizens important events in our history, as well as the heroism and
devotion of our soldiers, they are at best only events, although important ones,
in our history, while Yorktown marks the consummation of our national independence.
Other battles of the Revolutionary War led up to this one battle,
while battles of other wars since then were only struggles for our rights, or for the
preservation of the Government, whose existence was decided on the field at
Yorktown. It was at the bridge at Concord, Massachusetts, on April 19, 1775,
where the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard around the world.
It was on the field at Yorktown, Virginia, on October 19, 1781, that it was finally
decided after six and one-half years of heroic struggle that shot had not been fired
in vain. From that date the freedom of our country was secure and has never
again been in danger. The treaty of peace acknowledging our independence two
years later was but a natural and inevitable sequence to the surrender of our
opponent’s finest army and ablest general.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
